# human-behaviour-analysis
This is a machine learning model where we have predicted the human behaviour using Resnet model. We have used a balanced version of resnet which is Resnet50.

Dataset--> UCF Crime Dataset
You can download this dataset in kaggle.


If you want to get a higher accuracy try using Resnet 101 or Resnet 152. But make sure that model don't get overfitted.

Thanks :)
